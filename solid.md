## Single responsibility principle (SPR)

> A class should have only one reason to change.
>
> Robert C. Martin

## Open-closed principle (OCP)

> Software entities should be open for extension, but closed for modification
>
> Bertrand Meyer

## Liskov substitution principle (LSP)

> Functions that use pointers or references to base classes must be able to use objects of derived classes without knowing it.
>
> Barbara Liskov

## Interface segregation principle (ISP)

> No client should be forced to depend on methods it does not use.
>
> Robert C. Martin

## Dependency inversion principle (DIP)

> A. High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions.
> B. Abstractions should not depend on details. Details should depend on abstractions.
